# ID mapping to service and list

This list is used to map the custom IDs used in several '(artificial) service areas' to their respective services and the lists they are used in. This list does not include the standard IDs provided by Microsoft, only the custom ones created to cover gaps in the official lists or to separate services into more manageable parts.
